# Optimization-methods
Numerical optimization- and convex optimization methods will be introduced in this Repo
# Aim
This Repo is created to opensource some learning material and notiz when I'm learning numerical optimization.

# Visualization
[An Interactive Tutorial on Numerical Optimization](https://www.benfrederickson.com/numerical-optimization/) implements the visualization of some commonly used methods in Numerical Optimization: Nelder-Mead, Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient...
